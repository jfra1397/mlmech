bB = big Batch (64 per batch, still 20 steps per epochs used)
nS = no shift in data generator used
BN = Batch Normalization used
MC = Mulit-class Segmentation
SC = Single-class Segmentation
ES = EarlyStopping
2xConv2D = Tow Convolutional Layers in row used
Conv2DTranspose = Convolutional Transpose used instead of Upsampling
AddUpsampling = Added an Upsampling-layer to a Upsampling + Conv2D 
AddTranspose = Added an Upsampling-layer to a Transpose + Conv2D
AddDropout = Using the AddTranspose-Structure but with 30%-Dropout between the stages applied
KerasModel = Approach similar the example in computer vision at the keras-homepage
